**Example Problem Statement:**

Given an array `nums = [1, 2, 3]`, the output should be all possible subsets:

```
[[], [1], [2], [1, 2], [3], [1, 3], [2, 3], [1, 2, 3]]
```

## Problem Understanding

The goal of the problem is to generate all possible subsets of a given list of numbers. Given an array `nums`, we need to find all possible combinations of its elements, including the empty subset and the subset containing all elements.



## Intuition

Generating all subsets can be seen as a problem of generating all combinations. For a set with `n` elements, there are \(2^n\) possible subsets (including the empty subset). Each element in the array can either be included in a subset or not, which gives us a binary choice for each element.

## Binary Representation of Subsets

A useful way to approach this problem is to use bit manipulation. Here's why:

- If we think of each subset as a combination of elements, each element can be either included or excluded.
- This inclusion/exclusion can be represented as a binary number where each bit represents whether an element is included (1) or not (0).

For example, for the array `[1, 2, 3]`:
- `000` (binary) represents the empty subset `[]`.
- `001` (binary) represents the subset `[1]`.
- `010` (binary) represents the subset `[2]`.
- `011` (binary) represents the subset `[1, 2]`.
- `100` (binary) represents the subset `[3]`.
- `101` (binary) represents the subset `[1, 3]`.
- `110` (binary) represents the subset `[2, 3]`.
- `111` (binary) represents the subset `[1, 2, 3]`.

## Detailed Explanation of Code

Here's the code for generating all subsets:

```python
def generate_subsets(nums):
    n = len(nums)
    subsets = []
    for i in range(1 << n):  # 2^n combinations
        subset = []
        for j in range(n):
            if i & (1 << j):  # Check if j-th bit is set
                subset.append(nums[j])
        subsets.append(subset)
    return subsets

nums = [1, 2, 3]
print(generate_subsets(nums))
```

### Step-by-Step Breakdown

1. **Initialize Variables:**

```python
n = len(nums)
subsets = []
```
- `n` is the length of the input array `nums`.
- `subsets` is an empty list that will store all the subsets.

2. **Outer Loop: Iterate Over All Possible Combinations:**

```python
for i in range(1 << n):  # 2^n combinations
```
- `1 << n` is equivalent to \(2^n\). It represents the total number of subsets.
- We iterate `i` from 0 to \(2^n - 1\). Each value of `i` represents a binary number that can be used to determine which elements are included in the subset.

3. **Inner Loop: Determine Elements in the Current Subset:**

```python
subset = []
for j in range(n):
    if i & (1 << j):  # Check if j-th bit is set
        subset.append(nums[j])
```
- For each `i`, we initialize an empty list `subset`.
- We iterate over each bit position `j` from 0 to `n-1`.
- `1 << j` creates a mask with only the `j-th` bit set.
- `i & (1 << j)` checks if the `j-th` bit of `i` is set (i.e., if the `j-th` element should be included in the subset).
- If the bit is set, we append `nums[j]` to the current subset.

4. **Add the Current Subset to the List of Subsets:**

```python
subsets.append(subset)
```

5. **Return the List of All Subsets:**

```python
return subsets
```

## Example Walkthrough

Let's go through the example `nums = [1, 2, 3]`:

**Initialization:**

- `n = 3`
- `subsets = []`
- `1 << n = 8`, so `i` will iterate from 0 to 7.

**Iterations:**

- `i = 0` (binary `000`): `subset = []` (no bits set)
- `i = 1` (binary `001`): `subset = [1]` (only the 0th bit is set)
- `i = 2` (binary `010`): `subset = [2]` (only the 1st bit is set)
- `i = 3` (binary `011`): `subset = [1, 2]` (0th and 1st bits are set)
- `i = 4` (binary `100`): `subset = [3]` (only the 2nd bit is set)
- `i = 5` (binary `101`): `subset = [1, 3]` (0th and 2nd bits are set)
- `i = 6` (binary `110`): `subset = [2, 3]` (1st and 2nd bits are set)
- `i = 7` (binary `111`): `subset = [1, 2, 3]` (all bits are set)

At the end, `subsets` will contain all possible subsets of `nums`:

```python
[[], [1], [2], [1, 2], [3], [1, 3], [2, 3], [1, 2, 3]]
```

## Complexity Analysis

- **Time Complexity:** \(O(n * 2^n)\)
  - There are \(2^n\) subsets.
  - For each subset, we iterate through each element, leading to `n` iterations per subset.
- **Space Complexity:** \(O(n * 2^n)\)
  - We store all \(2^n\) subsets, and each subset can have up to `n` elements.

This approach is efficient and leverages the power of bitwise operations to systematically generate all subsets of the input array.
